h1. Greek & Latin Dictionaries

This are two ePub versions from two beginners' dictionaries for classical languages: _An Intermediate Greek--English Lexicon_ by Henry George Liddell and _An Elementary Latin Dictionary_ by Charlton T. Lewis.

These dictionaries come from the Perseus Project, but they don't have a @textile@ source file. They actually come from two files for Kindle that I found at "Mobileread":.

They are far from being perfect (and I don't claim or intend them to be). I know that proper Greek is missing form the Latin dictionary.

The ePub documents have the fonts embedded. Otherwise they aren't readable with a e--ink reader. Searching isn't possible unless you can write the words as displayed text with all diacritics.
